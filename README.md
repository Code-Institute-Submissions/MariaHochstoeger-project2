# Indian Weddings for Beginners - A Quiz

Visit the live site [here](https://mariahochstoeger.github.io/project2/).

![responsive mock-up](...)

This is a quiz about Indian weddings. It lets the user test their knowledge about some of the most common events - usually called "functions" - of a traditional Indian Hindu wedding. On the website and in this readme, the terms "Hindu wedding" and "Indian wedding" are used interchangeably.

## Design

The site was created with persons in mind who have not had any point of contact with traditional Indian weddings so far. The aim was to evoke feelings of joy and celebration, and a distant association to India, through colors and fonts. Besides that, the design is kept very simple and minimal as to not distract the user from the quiz and reading and answering the questions.

### Wireframes

The wireframes were made in Figma. A mockup of a mobile screen was chosen since the site was built using the mobile-first approach. The wireframes were kept very simple and the focus was on structure rather than design. The wireframes also include a countdown field which was not implemented in the basic version of the game. It is a possible future feature.

### Font and Colour Choices
**Fonts:** 'Laila' was chosen as the font for the header and main headings for its playful design with its slight nod to the Indian letters used for Hindi, Devanagari, through its gentle flares and curles at the end of the letter strokes. 'Poppins' makes up the main part of the site due to it being a quite neutral, easy-to-read but still friendly font.

**Colours:** The colour palette was generated using [mycolor.space](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23FA00A6&sub=1). The reference colours were picked from the inspiration image (taken from Pexel) which shows a man with his face full of paint powder, which is common during one of the biggest Indian festivals, Holi, also called the Festival of Colors. Although Holi does not have an association with Indian weddings, the color scheme was chosen as these types of colors are often associated with India more broadly. Furthermore, the colors are bright, vivid and fun, which is an association the quiz would like to evoke.

**Images:** No images are displayed on the site itself. As described above, an inspiration image was used to generate the colour palette.

## Features

The site has the very basic features of a static website.

- **Navigation Bar**
    - The navigation bar is always visible on all pages. In the top left corner the logo is a link which brings the user back to the home page, as a user would expect it to.
    - The page which is currently active is underlined in the header.
    - Depending on the screen format, the navigation bar is split into two lines or spaced onto a single line (tablets and wider).

    ![Navigation Bar](assets/images/readme-images/navigation-bar.png)

- **Hero image**
    - The hero image was chosen as it depicts the Sch√∂nbrunn castle, one of Vienna's most famous sites. 
    - The relation to Vienna was deemed to be important as this is an English-language website targeted mostly at people located in Vienna. This way, people immediately get an association with Vienna even though the site is not in German language.
    - Also, for those with some more knowledge about psychoanalytics, Sigmund Freud, the "godfather of psychoanalytics" was from and mostly worked in Vienna. In professional circles, Vienna still has a very good reputation when it comes to producing good psychoanalysts/psychotherapists.
    - Since the rest of the site is quite calm and quiet, it was decided to keep the image at full opacity to make it pop.

- **Main section**
    - Subheaders on all pages give cues about the content of the individual parts.
    - Content varies depending on the page. 
    - Texts are kept short to help the user find information quickly.

- **Home page and call to action**
    - A picture of Dr. Himanshu Giri greets the user to give them a first impression of him. It is rounded for a softer look.
    - The welcome text gives the user a first understanding of what Dr. Giri offers.
    - Layout is vertical for smaller screens and horizontal to make good use of larger screens.
    - A call to action motivates the user to book a session. The button is a link which directs the user to the contact page.

    ![Home page including headshot of Dr Giri, welcome text and call to action](assets/images/readme-images/home-page-incl-headshot-text-and-call-to-action.png)

- **About page**
    - Images are related to the content they are associated with. They show pictures of various scenes which one might encounter in a therapy setting.
    - The information that site visitors will mostly look for is listed in clear list format, using bullet points where too many items make up the list.
    - Little icons give a playful vibe, giving lightness to heavy issues.
    - Layout is vertical for smaller screens and horizontal to make good use of larger screens.

    ![About page](assets/images/readme-images/about-page.png)

- **Contact page**
    - A form encourages visitors to leave their contact details for Dr. Giri to get in touch with them directly.
    - Should the site visitor choose to contact Dr. Giri themselves, they are provided with the address, email and phone details. The email address is provided as a link.
    - On larger screens, the contact information is displayed horizontally and separated into two columns for a cleaner look.

    ![Contact page](assets/images/readme-images/contact-page.png)

- **Footer**
    - The footer contains three icons which link to external social media sites.
    - The links open in new tabs, making it easy for users to come back to the site of Dr. Giri.
    - The footer is consistent throughout the pages.

### Possible Future Features

- Include a video

    Dr. Giri has given a Ted Talk. I would like to embed this video directly on the about page.

- Improve the about page

    Make the costs on the about page into a table giving an easier overview to the site visitor.

- Give the user more options with the form

    I would like to give the site visitor the option to choose whether they would like to be contacted via email or via phone, and if phone, at which times.

## UX

### Site Goals

The site wants to attract people who face mental or psychological challenges in their lives and are looking for professional help from a qualified psychotherapist. Particularly, the site should speak to English- or Hindi-speaking people located in Vienna, or who would like to try psychotherapy online. 

### User Stories

**As a site visitor:**

- I want to confirm that Dr. Giri is a qualified psychotherapist.
- I want to know which languages Dr. Giri speaks.
- I want to learn about the types of sessions he offers.
- I want to know how much a session costs.
- I want to find out whether Dr. Giri specializes in the field which I struggle with.
- I want to see where Dr. Giri is located.
- I want to be able to get in contact with Dr. Giri in the manner that I choose to.
- I want to see a mobile-friendly layout and responsive design.

**As the site administrator:**

- I want to be able to easily update information such as pricing or location.
- I want to be able to add new content such as videos.

## Testing

- I confirmed that this project is responsive and looks good on various common screen sizes by using the devtools devices toolbar.
- I have confirmed that the form works and each field is required. There are error messages if a field is not filled out. If it is filled incorrectly, such as an @ missing in an email, or the phone number field containing letters, there are appropriate error messages.
- I confirmed that header and navbar are easily readable and understandable.

### Fixed Bugs

- Imported Google Fonts into html via <link>. This caused css-classes and -ids to not be applied. Fixed it by removing Google Fonts link from index.html and instead importing Google Fonts into style.css.
- Various flexbox styling problems. Fixed flexbox styling by applying differently colored borders to better understand the individual elements' behaviours. Border colors were removed after fixing the styling.

### Unfixed Bugs

- None.

### Validator Testing

- HTML ([W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/))
    - 3 errors found: two out of three errors were "section lacks heading". The other one was "The element ```a``` must not be a descendent of the `button` element."
    - Solution: introduced headings to the two relevant sections and set them to non-displayed. Styling the `a` as a button and removing the button element.

- CSS ([Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/))
    - 1 error found: "min-width too many values or values are not recognized: `none`".
    - Solution: removed min-width. It wasn't necessary anyways.

- Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO (Lighthouse Chrome Dev Tools)
    - Accessibility is at 100, which is what the focus was one.
Performance is mediocre, also after compressing images.
